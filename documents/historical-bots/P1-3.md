# P1-3

These are the first prototypes of Vector. These are rare and I (Wire) only have a broken P2 headboard. I haven't been able to get my hands on any other P-era part.

These could be considered EVT (Engineering Validation Test) bots, though Vector never had an official EVT stage.

# P1

P1 was a very tiny first batch of Vectors. They contain all of the final hardware, but some things may not be hooked up correctly. There is an extra wire on the spine connector for timing which was taken away in P2. The headboard contains a connector which can connect it to a debug breakout board. They likely have an eMMC chip which has double the storage and RAM of normal Vectors. I personally have never come across one, so I don't know much else than that. If you have one somehow, please tell us.

# P2

P2 is more finalized. One user was able to use QDL to upgrade one's headboard to the latest software, and everything worked fine. The bodyboard is still in an early stage. The body plastics are 99% finalized. The only one we have come across had black plastic.

# P3

P3 seems to be very similar to DVT1. We haven't come across a fully-put-together P3 bot.
